## Introduction


Smart Pods are the core element of Renforce. They allow you to deploy AI infrastructure and execute AI tasks in your project safely and simply.

  

## SmartPod Architecture

  

Our Smart Pods have the following elements to understand their architecture:

  

#### Internal elements

- **AI Orchestrator:** Chooses or connects with the best AI model for a specific task.
- **Ren-Rag-V:** Our sophisticated RAG system to extract the best results from your knowledge quickly, simply, and inexpensively.
- **SLMs:** We employ different small language models to interact with your data. These SLMs are private and donâ€™t use your information for other business purposes. These SLMs only support our RAG system and improve the results.
- **Security layers:** Our orchestrator has different security layers to prevent attacks like prompt injections. This feature is continuously being improved by our team.

  

#### External elements

- **Sources:** Knowledge databases are attached to this pod. These sources can include document repositories, databases, or external connections (such as Jira, Airtable, etc.)
- **Functions:** Define processes that the AI can execute in this pod, such as sending emails, creating documents, performing QA on documents, etc.
- **Prompts:** Prompts defined for you to give instructions to the AI. Among these prompts you can find: System prompts, Output prompts (to define how you want the AI result), and Examples (to help the AI understand the expected result).
