## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines natural language processing (NLP) with external document retrieval to generate contextually relevant, high-quality responses. RAG leverages pre-trained language models, such as GPT, and supplements them with information retrieved from a structured or unstructured knowledge base. This approach is especially useful in scenarios where the underlying language model's training data might be outdated, incomplete, or insufficient for domain-specific queries.

For developers, RAG offers a flexible and scalable solution to embed knowledge into their applications without requiring extensive fine-tuning of the language model. By using our platform, you can deploy production-ready RAG instances with ease, enabling your applications to retrieve information, process it, and generate accurate responses in real-time.

### Why Use RAG?

* **Dynamic and Up-to-Date Responses**: Since RAG retrieves information from custom indexes, it ensures responses are based on the most current and relevant data available.

* **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: RAG can easily integrate with your proprietary datasets, making it ideal for specialized applications like legal advice, medical support, or technical troubleshooting.

* **Cost-Effective**: Instead of fine-tuning massive language models, RAG relies on lightweight retrieval mechanisms, which can significantly reduce costs and development time.

* **Scalable**: With our platform, you can manage multiple RAG instances for different use cases, ensuring high performance even in production environments.

* **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding responses in retrieved data, RAG reduces hallucination (unreliable or fabricated answers) from the language model.

### Example Use Cases

Here are some practical scenarios where RAG can be utilized:

1. **Customer Support**: Deploy a chatbot that retrieves answers from your company's product manuals, FAQs, or support databases to provide accurate and helpful responses.

2. **E-Learning**: Enhance online learning platforms by enabling students to ask questions and get answers based on course material or research papers.

3. **Enterprise Search**: Build robust search functionality for internal knowledge bases, enabling employees to access relevant documents and insights quickly.

4. **Healthcare**: Create an assistant that retrieves and summarizes medical guidelines, research articles, or patient history for doctors and healthcare professionals.

5. **Legal Research**: Enable lawyers to query legal documents, case law, and statutes to find relevant precedents or summaries.

Our platform simplifies the process of creating and managing RAG instances, empowering developers to focus on building high-impact applications without worrying about the complexities of infrastructure, indexing, or scaling.

## Create a RAG Instance

This section explains how to create a RAG instance on our platform. Follow these steps to set up your instance and customize it according to your use case.

Params:

* `name` (Required)

* `description` (Optional)

* `sync_mode` *automatic* or *manual* (Optional, *automatic* by default)

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  client_rag.create(
    name="Test RAG",
    description="This a test", 
    sync_mode="automatic"
  )
  ```

  ```
  console.log("Hello World");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Index a Document

Learn how to index individual documents into your RAG instance. This process enables your application to retrieve relevant information from custom datasets.

Params:

* `file` pdf or image format (Required)

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  client_rag.index(file="example.pdf")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Index a Loader

Explore how to use loaders to index batches of documents or data sources into your RAG instance, making it easy to manage large datasets efficiently.

Params:

* `loader_id` (Required)

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  client_rag.index_loader(loader_id="your_loader_id")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Search in Your Index

Discover how to perform searches in your RAG index. This section demonstrates the query process and how to retrieve useful information from your indexed data.

Params:

* `query`: User query - *Required*

* `k`: Number of coincidences in the response - *Optional (5 by default)*

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  client_rag.search(
    query="Where did Tesla live?",
    k=10
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Filter by**

You can also filter by:

* `files`: This allows you to search for matches in a specific document..

* `loaders`: This allows you to search for coincidences in documents of a loader.

```python Python
client_rag.search(
  query="Where did Tesla live?"
).filter_by(files=["your_file_ids"])
```

## Remove Data from Your RAG

**File**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python helloWorld.js
  client_rag.remove.file("your_file_id_to_remove")
  ```
</CodeGroup>



**Loader**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python helloWorld.js
  client_rag.remove.loader("your_loader_id_to_remove")
  ```
</CodeGroup>
